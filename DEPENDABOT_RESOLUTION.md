## Security Vulnerabilities

### Current Status
- **7 vulnerabilities identified** (2 moderate, 5 high)
- Vulnerabilities related to: `d3-color`, `esbuild`
- Breaking changes would be required to fix all issues

### Affected Dependencies
1. **d3-color** - ReDoS vulnerability (used by react-simple-maps)
2. **esbuild** - Development server vulnerability (used by Vite)

### Recommendation
These vulnerabilities are:
- Primarily in transitive dependencies
- Would require major version updates to fix completely
- The `d3-color` issue is in `react-simple-maps@3.0.0` (already latest)
- The `esbuild` issue would require Vite v6+ (breaking change from v5.4.20)

## Next Steps

### Option 1: GitHub PR Management (Manual)
Since dependabot PRs are created automatically, you can:
1. Visit the repository on GitHub
2. Check open dependabot PRs
3. Either merge them (if tests pass) or close them (if superseded)
4. The GitHub Actions dependencies may need manual review

### Option 2: Force Fix All Vulnerabilities
To fix all vulnerabilities (requires careful testing):
```bash
npm audit fix --force
```
This will update to Vite 6.4.0 and react-simple-maps to 1.0.0 (breaking changes).
